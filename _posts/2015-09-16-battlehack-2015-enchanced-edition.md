My first ever hackathlon to participate was Battlehack 2015 - Athens. It was a
unique experience that I will repeat when similar opportunity occurs. In this
post I gathered my posts from the old blog and the video I created after the
event was over.

{% include alert.html type="info" message="The following post is a merge of the
pre-Battlehack(posted at 12-5-15) and after-Battlehack(posted at 1-6-15) posts I
published at the old blog. Most of the text has not been changed but I made
various changes to the code, so that the post is more friendly to the new theme.
I also added a timelapse video I made afterwards."

# Part One - Before the event

The day has come, for me to finally participate to the Battlehack 2015 - Athens.
I was not sure if it was worth it and I still have my doubts but I will not know
if I won't try.

The start was made half a week before, when Stavros posted the following on DSG
Team's private Group:

Truth is I have never participated in a hackathlon before. I practically have
zero experience. That's why I hesitated at first. But then, I thought that I
will never gain experience unless I make a start and I believe the time for a
start is now.

What made easier my choice is that I won't be alone. You see, you can
participate at Battlehack 2015 - Athens with a team of up to 4 members. The
other 3 that complete the team are Stavros, Charis (Dimos) and Dimitris.

We all are (or were) members of DSG and that's how we got to know each other.
We have never cooperated before but hopefully the team will bond well enough to
become a noteworthy Battlehack contestant. If not, well as I said above, it will
be an experience nonetheless.

If we win Battlehack 2015 - Athens we will qualify for the world finals that
will take place at Silicon Valley! There we will compete with the other cities'
Battlehack winners for a $100K prize.

However this is going to happen many months from now so let's just focus on the
Greek qualifications that will take place in Athens. Here's the full schedule:

# Part Two - After the event

Battlehack 2015 Athens is now history. Some weeks ago when I said that I was
going to participate, I said I had my doubts if it was worth it. Now that is
over, I finally know the answer. :)

If you do not want to wait, or bored to death to read what I wrote, the answer
is that, It was absolutely worth it!

For those how want to continue reading, here's me at the first day of the
event :)

## The event

Battlehack is my first hackathlon that I participated and that's why I cannot
compare it with any previous experience. However participating in FOSSCOMM 2014
gives me something to do so.

The guys from Braintree did a perfect job in organizing the event. From day one
they were 24/7 available for any problem we may had, helped us with any obstacle
we encountered and kept our stomachs full.

I do not think there was anything else to be done from these guys. They did
everything perfect.

## The contestants

The biggest negative of the event was the lack of contestants. For an event as 
big as Battlehack with sold-outs everywhere, having about 50 contestants (half
the tables were empty) was disappointing. Hopefully Braintree will come again in
the future despite that.

As I said in my previous post, I participated mostly for the experience. I
wasn't ready to compete in a full-scale "war" with other developers. I thought
that I was going to be amazed from what the other teams will come up.

Truth is, except from the 1st and 2nd winner teams of the event and one or two
teams that failed at their presentations but had a great project, everyone else
had poor ideas and even worse implementations.

## Food4Charity

Our team developed a website where you will donate meals to specific restaurants
and they will feed those meals to people that are homeless or unable to pay for
them.

For our implementation we won Sendgrid's award that was a BRAVEN Mobile speaker.

Truth is, the quality of our project and the above award won't be possible
without Stavros's efforts. As I said before, I was there for the experience and
so was Polykarpos and up to a point we were good enough to built the front end
and a few graphics. Our project was good enough to say we tried and we are not
the last team but not one of the top5 either :) .

Then Stavros took the team to his shoulders, implemented Sendgrid's API that was
perfect enough to give as the award for best implementation and after seeing the
rehearsals of the other teams we believed a 3rd place was even possible.

We never made it to 3rd but for me was a weekend to be remembered. And if
Battlehack 2016 comes to Athens next year, I will definitely be a part of it.

# Bonus Part - Timelapse Video
After posting the two parts above, I created a timelapse of my laptop camera of
the event. Here's the video:
