Twelve years ago I started my online journey by participating in Gamebattles.gr.
Now, twelve years later, after a decade of ups and downs, I am continuing what
started on 2009. 

My name is John and Prantalos.com is my current online home. But this was not
always the case.

My story begins in 2009 on Gamebattles.gr where I signed up as the user
"Pandorian". It was a few days ago that I had seen John Cameron's Avatar in the
cinema - my first 3D experience - and I was such a fan of the lore that I
created a new nickname based on Pandora, the planet of Na'vi.

Since then I created and participated on projects like:

* Trackmania Hellas (trackmania.gr)

* Enraged Studios (enragedstudios.eu)

* Wolfpack Studios (wolfpackstudios.eu)

* Ultimate Greekz

* Fake Reality

* Vortex Animation Studios

* Ivan Foundation

* Pandorian Artworks

* The Third Age (T3A)

* Suprabal Greece (supraball.gr)

and had personal websites and blogs under different domains, like:

* pandorian.gr

* pandorian.eu

* pandorian.net

* pandorian.wolfpackstudios.eu

* johnprantalos.gr

* johnprantalos.eu

* thatguy.gr

Over the years as my interests changed all of them one by one came to an end.

However, I wanted to come back and so I did with prantalos.com.

With a little help of archive.org and my personal backups I have managed to
restore many of my old posts and re-upload them here.

All posts before this one have been written somewhere else by me. Consider them
my archive. I tried to transfer most their contect intact, so keep in mind that
there will be dead links and probably some issues.

Let the reboot begin!
